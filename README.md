# To-Do-List-Python-App

This is my first web app written using Python Flask.

Users may create an account and log in. Once logged in, they may add tasks to their to do list, with options to edit or delete. They will also see current weather info right above.

If users mistype their login info and thus fail to log in, a message will be displayed to let them know, signaling them to try again.
